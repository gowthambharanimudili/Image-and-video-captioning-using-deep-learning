# Image-and-video-captioning-using-deep-learning
We present an image and video captioning application that addresses new challenges of automatically describing images and videos. The task involves making a high-quality caption based on human decisions. Image Captioning, automatically generating natural language descriptions according to the content observed in an image, is an important part of scene understanding, which combines the knowledge of computer vision and a natural language processing. This idea can be put into practice using “deep learning” The Task of Image Captioning divided into two modules logically. First one is ‘Image based model’, which extracts the features and information about the Image and second one is ‘Language based model’, which translates the features and objects given by our image to natural sentences. In order to make this application available to everyone, developing a graphical user interface is the best way. So, this project is mainly comprising of a graphical user interface that generates natural language description to a given image or video and also developing an interface in order to access Image captioning applications
